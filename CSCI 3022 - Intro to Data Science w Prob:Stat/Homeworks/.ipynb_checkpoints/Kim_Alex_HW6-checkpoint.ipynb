    "This assignment is due on Canvas by **MIDNIGHT on Monday November 2**. Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown directly below the associated question.  Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTES**: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Any relevant data sets should be available under the **Data** module on Canvas, as well as in the zipped folder in which you obtained this assignment. \n",
    "- Do **NOT** load or use any Python packages that are not available in Anaconda 3.6. \n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells in a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do Kernel $\\rightarrow$ Restart & Run All as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",
    "- It is **bad form** to make your reader interpret numerical output from your code.  If a question asks you to compute some value from the data you should show your code output **AND** write a summary of the results in Markdown directly below your code. \n",
    "- You **MUST** leave all of your notebook cells **evaluated** so the graders do not need to re-evaluate them. For 100+ students, this extra time adds up, and makes the graders' lives unnecessarily more difficult.\n",
    "- This probably goes without saying, but... For any question that asks you to calculate something, you **must show all work and justify your answers to receive credit**. Sparse or nonexistent work will receive sparse or nonexistent credit. \n",
    "- Submit only this Jupyter notebook to Canvas.  Do not compress it using tar, rar, zip, etc. \n",

You have been contacted by a shadowy organization to assess whether there is statistical evidence for sea-level rise in the area of Honolulu, Hawaii.

Toward this end, your employer wants to find a decade of data (11 years, including both end points) that has a mean sea level which is not statistically significantly different from the mean sea level in the decade 2000-2010 (including data from both 2000 and 2010).
