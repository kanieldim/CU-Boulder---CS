    "## Problem 1 : Implement a Fitness Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we ask you to complete a fitness function and some other associated utility functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will describe the modified Sudoku problem data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SudokuBoard Python Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The sudoku board has the following fields, please read carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `self.prefills` : a dictionary mapping cell coordinates `(i,j)` to the initial value `k` that was present in the __original__ problem instance. Cells that are originally blank are not part of the dictionary. \n",
    "  - `self.allowed_entries`: a dictionary mapping cell coordinates `(i,j)` to a __list of all possible values__ `k` that can possible be at cell `(i,j)` without causing a repeated entry given the prefills in row `i`, column `j` or block corresponding to cell `(i,j)`.\n",
    "    - Note: that prefilled coordinates `(i,j)` are present in this dictionary and simply mapped to a singleton list `k`.\n",
    "    - Also note that the dictionary contains a non-empty list for each `(i,j)` with `1 <= i <= 9` and `1 <= j <= 9`.\n",
    "    - Function: `self.compute_allowed_entries_for_cell( i, j)` is called by the constructor to populate this dictionary. Please examine the code.\n",
    "  - `self.state`: A dictionary that maps each `(i,j)` to some value `k`. However, it need not be __valid__. That is there may be repeated entries in some rows, columns or blocks.\n",
    "    - Important Property 1: If `self.state[(i,j)] = k` then `k` must be an element of `self.allowed_entries[(i,j)]`.\n",
    "    - Important Property 2: `self.state` has an entry for each `(i,j)` with `1 <= i <= 9` and `1 <= j <= 9`.\n",
    "    - Function: `self.initialize_state` initializes `self.state` to a random initial state. Examine and understand the code for this function.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Implement Fitness Function (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will first implement `self.compute_fitness_score` function below that computes a numerical score of how \"fit\" the current state `self.state` is. \n",
    "  - For each row from 1 to 9, \n",
    "    - compute how many __unique entries__ row has. I.e collect all numbers in row and count how many unique numbers are in the row. \n",
    "    - Subtract 9 from the number of __unique entries__ and add result to the overall fitness.\n",
    "  - For each col from 1 to 9\n",
    "    - compute how many __unique entries__ col has. \n",
    "    - Subtract 9 from the number of __unique entries__ and add result to the overall fitness.\n",
    "  - For each blk from (1,1) to (3,3)\n",
    "    - compute how many __unique entries__ blk has. \n",
    "    - Subtract 9 from the number of __unique entries__ and add result to the overall fitness.\n",
    "  \n",
    "If the Sudoku is solved, the fitness function is zero since each row, column and block have 9 unique entries. \n",
    "Otherwise, the fitness function is negative since, for example,  if a row has `5` unique entries (i.e, there are 4 repetitions), its contribution to the fitness function is `5-9 = -4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "___Trick___: given a list of numbers `lst` from 1 - 9, you can compute the number of unique entries in `lst` by simply converting `lst` to a set and returning the size of the set.\n",

    "I want to say that I had the best solution fitness when I set initial_temperature = 3, num_trials = 1500, cooling_schedule = (100, 0.4). When I first tried num_trail = 4000, and initial_temperature = 40, I noticed that most of the sudoku were cooling to 0.0 by around 1500 ~ 2000 iteration. To make things more efficient, I tried plugging in different numbers and I ended up getting initial_temperature = 3, num_trials = 1500, cooling_schedule = (100, 0.4) with the lowest score -8. Comparing the results it seems that all 3 difficulties ended up with similar results. "
