Welcome to the Store!
YOU HAD SAVED $1200 TO SPEND FOR THE TRIP, AND YOU'VE INITIALLY PAID $200 FOR A WAGON. YOU WILL NEED TO SPEND THE REST OF YOUR MONEY ON THE FOLLOWING ITEMS:
- OXEN. YOU CAN SPEND $100-$200 ON YOUR TEAM. THE MORE YOU SPEND, THE FASTER YOU'LL GO BECAUSE YOU'LL HAVE BETTER ANIMALS
- FOOD. THE MORE YOU HAVE, THE LESS CHANCE THERE IS OF GETTING SICK
- BULLETS - $2 BUYS A BELT OF 20 BULLETS. YOU WILL NEED BULLETS FOR ATTACKS BY ANIMALS AND BANDITS, AND FOR HUNTING FOOD
