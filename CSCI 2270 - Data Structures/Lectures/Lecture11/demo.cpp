LEGOOOOOOOOO
LET'S FUCKING DO THISSSSSSS
PICKLE RICKKKKKKK

Binary Tree
Properties
 - Each node has parent
 - topmost node is called the root
 - root's parent is null
 - each node has a key that identifies it
 - each node has exactly 2 children (two little DKs)
 - if one of the children is non-existant
  - children is null
 - if both children are null, then node is called a leaf
 - self-similarity: a tree is composed of smaller sub-trees

 *parent
 *parnet -> key
 *parent -> LL or *parent -> RL


 BST
  - special case of binary trees
  - great for being searched!

  simple rules
  - left child always has a smaller key value than right child
